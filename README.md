##Title
HEO website
<br/>
##Description
HEO(Help Each Other) is a website where people can post their small diffculties, and any stranger can come to help them out.<br/>
For instance, old people who live alone can ask someone to help change lamp or move furniture via our website.<br/>
Disabled people can ask someone to get grocery for him/her by posting in our website.<br/>
##Vision statement
All the people can use our website to help each other. 
<br/>
##Motivation
Nowadays, people are more into the virtual world on the Internet, and are more likely to ignore the relationship among real people. We want to help all the members in our community to know each other, and give people a helping hand when they have difficulty in their daily life.
