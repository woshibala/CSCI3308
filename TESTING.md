##Title
HEO website
<br/>
##Vision
HEO(Help Each Other) is a website where people can post their small diffculties, and any stranger can come to help them out.<br/>
For instance, old people who live alone can ask someone to help change lamp or move furniture via our website.<br/>
Disabled people can ask someone to get grocery for him/her by posting in our website.<br/>
##Automated Tests
>Explanation<br/>
We use a Python standard library module: TestCase.unittest to do the automated tests.<br/>
We mainly test the database models in this project by creating some instances of User and Article and checking checking the value in the instances.<br/>
